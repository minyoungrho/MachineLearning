# Machine Learning

This repository provides introduction to machine learning models 

1. (regression) to predict scores of a child from the income of the parents 
2. (classficiation) to predict whether a patient tests positive with Covid-19 from blood pressure, lung capacity, and body temperature 

using a simple, simulated data set. 

## Programming + Libraries:
I use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) library for Python programming language.


## Description:
In this repository, we build machine learning predictive models using the following method 

1. Linear Regressions
2. Tree Models
3. Random Fores
4. XGBoost
5. Logistic Regression
6. Support Vector Machine
7. k-Nearest Neighbor

and tune hyperparameters for each of the above method using the following algorithms

1. GridSearch
2. RandomGridSearch

and select the optimal model based on the following metrics calculated using cross-validation to quantify the quality of the prediction

1. Mean squared error
2. Absolute squared error
3. Accuracy score
4. area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operating characteristic (ROC)

Lastly, we also look into dimensionality reduction methods.
